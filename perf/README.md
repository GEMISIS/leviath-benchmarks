# perf

Measurement tooling for leviath itself: the daemon, `lev serve` and
`lev dash`. The performance track in `bench/` answers "what does a workload
cost"; this directory holds the probes behind individual changes to
leviath - a dashboard's key latency, a route's p99, a leak's staircase - and
the baselines those changes were measured against. The point of it is
that any number we publish about leviath's resource usage is reproducible,
uses the right metric for the OS it was taken on, and says exactly what it
means. If you are comparing leviath against anything else, use the same
metrics on both sides or the comparison is meaningless.

## Tools

- The process monitor is [`../bench/monitor.py`](../bench/monitor.py). It
  samples one process (CPU as whole-machine share, every memory metric the
  OS provides, active session count), writes a CSV per sample, and
  reconstructs exact per-run concurrency from filesystem timestamps. This
  directory keeps the methodology notes below plus the experiments that
  verified them.
- `ws_churn_test.py` - opens batches of WebSocket connections against
  `lev serve` and drops them abruptly (SO_LINGER 0, like a killed browser
  tab), printing the server's RSS between batches. A per-connection leak shows
  up as a staircase.

## The measuring sticks the cleanup work is gated on

Every performance PR to leviath has to move one of the numbers below,
measured the same way before and after, or it does not merge. Everything
here drives a `lev` binary from the outside: build the one you are measuring
(`cargo build --release` in a leviath checkout) and pass it as `LV_BIN`, or
leave `LV_BIN` unset to use the `lev` on your `PATH`.

- `harness.sh` - the isolated environment every live probe runs in. Wraps a
  command in `env -i` with a short `LEVIATH_HOME` (`/tmp/lv`), any `.env`
  skipped, and the native OpenAI provider pointed at `mock.py`. Use it as a
  prefix: `perf/harness.sh lev ps`. It also
  installs `agents/probe/`, a one-stage blueprint that calls whatever tool
  the mock asks for.
- `mock.py PORT [TOOL ARGS-JSON]` - a stateless OpenAI-compatible provider.
  It decides from the request body, never a turn counter (the daemon spends
  a turn at startup): the tool call is returned until `messages` carries a
  `role: "tool"` entry, then the reply is `done`. `GET /count` says how many
  completions it served, which is what makes a "no provider call happened"
  probe provable rather than silent.
- `daemon_drive.py --runs K [--tool NAME --args JSON --yolo]` - starts the
  mock, a daemon and `lev serve`, spawns K runs, waits for them to finish,
  and prints wall clock plus rusage as JSON. Run it through `harness.sh`.
- `fake_runs.py --from RUN_DIR --count 750 --out DIR [--fanout K]` - copies
  one real run directory N times with fresh ids. Copies, not stubs: a
  200-byte `context.json` would hide exactly the per-frame parsing cost the
  dashboard numbers exist to catch. On APFS the copies are copy-on-write
  clones, so 5,000 of a 7 MB run cost next to no disk. `--fanout K` shapes the
  corpus like fan-out work: one parent, then its K children, repeated.
- `serve_latency.py --port 8299 --n 200 [--burst] [--accept-encoding gzip]` -
  p50/p99 per read route over a fixed corpus, one connection per request.
  `--burst` fires the console's connect-time set (config, first runs page,
  blueprints, models, folder listing, update plan) at once and reports the
  wall clock to the last byte, which is what a user waits for when The Lair
  opens. `--accept-encoding` records the compressed body size and the
  `content-encoding` the server chose.
- `dash_pty.py --bin lev --seconds 30 --keys 'jjj' [--burst N]
  [--ready-text TEXT]` - drives `lev dash` over a real pty, accumulating the
  whole escape stream (a full pty buffer blocks the child and corrupts the
  measurement), and reports the child's CPU seconds, max RSS, bytes written,
  repaint count and a normalised hash of the first frame. It also times how
  long the list takes to show `TEXT` (`ready_ms`), each key to the repaint
  that answers it (`key_latency_ms`), and, with `--burst`, how long the
  screen keeps changing after N wheel notches and N pointer moves arrive at
  once (`burst_settle_ms`). It answers the terminal queries crossterm sends
  at start-up, as a real terminal does; a silent pty adds a 2 s wait to
  every number. The hash must match before and after a change; the CPU and
  the syscall count (`measure.sh`, Linux) must fall.
- `measure.sh CMD...` - `perf stat` + `strace -c` on Linux, `/usr/bin/time
  -l` on macOS. Linux is the gate; macOS is corroboration.
- `binsize.sh [BIN]` - release binary size, package count, `__const` /
  `.rodata` size, and whether the unreachable tiktoken vocabularies are still
  linked in.
- `baselines/` - one JSON per leviath commit the numbers were taken at,
  named `<date>-<leviath sha>.json`. Compare against the newest one.

## Memory metrics: what they mean, and the trap

The single most common benchmarking mistake for long-lived processes is
graphing RSS and calling it "memory usage". It is wrong in the same way on
both macOS and Linux:

Modern allocators return freed memory to the kernel *lazily*, via
`MADV_FREE` (Linux) / `MADV_FREE_REUSABLE` (macOS). The kernel takes those
pages back only under memory pressure - until then they still count in RSS
(and on Linux, in PSS and USS too). So a process that spiked once and freed
everything keeps reporting its high-water mark forever. That is allocator
bookkeeping, not held memory, and it is invisible to `ps`, `top`'s RES
column, and most dashboards.

Both halves of that claim are verified by experiment in this repo, not
folklore:

- **Linux** (`linux_mem_check` experiment, runnable in any container):
  allocate 300 MB anonymous memory, touch every page, `madvise(MADV_FREE)`
  the lot. Measured result: `Rss` and `Pss` in `smaps_rollup` still report
  ~310 MB, the `LazyFree` field reports the 300 MB, and `Pss - LazyFree`
  lands back at the ~10 MB baseline.
- **macOS**: an idle leviath daemon measured 292.8 MB RSS while
  `vmmap --summary` reported a 21.7 MB physical footprint - the difference
  was exactly the `MALLOC_SMALL (empty)` reclaimable regions.
- **macOS, second layer**: physical footprint itself still counts pages the
  allocator returned via `MADV_FREE_REUSABLE`. A settled post-burst daemon
  measured 50 MB footprint of which the `/usr/bin/footprint` category table
  flagged 48 MB as `Reclaimable` - pages the kernel repossesses under
  pressure, holding no data (the in-process reachable heap at that moment was
  ~2 MB). So on macOS the reclaimable column is the twin of Linux's
  `LazyFree` and gets subtracted the same way.

The monitor therefore records every raw metric and one corrected series:

| column | macOS | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rss_mb` | psutil RSS | psutil RSS | psutil RSS (working set) |
| `pss_mb` | - | `smaps_rollup` `Pss` | - |
| `uss_mb` | - | `Private_Clean + Private_Dirty` | psutil USS |
| `lazy_free_mb` | `footprint` `Reclaimable` | `smaps_rollup` `LazyFree` | - |
| `live_mb` | footprint minus reclaimable | `Pss - LazyFree` | USS |

`live_mb` is the headline series: the memory the process actually holds.

- macOS physical footprint is the kernel's own accounting (what Activity
  Monitor's Memory column shows); subtracting its reclaimable portion removes
  the lazily-freed pages it still counts. psutil cannot provide USS/PSS on
  macOS without root, and `top` costs over a second of system time per query;
  `/usr/bin/footprint` answers in ~30 ms unprivileged.
- On Linux, `LazyFree` pages are private to the freeing process, so
  subtracting the field from PSS is exact, not an estimate.
- Windows decommits freed heap immediately (no lazy-free mechanism), so USS
  needs no correction.

One attribution trap worth knowing when you point Apple's tools at `lev`
yourself: mimalloc (the default allocator) tags its arena mappings with VM
tag 100, which `vmmap`, `footprint`, and Instruments all label
`IOAccelerator` as if the process held GPU driver memory. It does not - a
headless daemon never loads the AGX Metal driver. Launching with
`MIMALLOC_OS_TAG=240` relabels the very same regions `app-specific tag 1`,
which is how we proved the post-burst "IOAccelerator" residue is just empty,
reclaimable heap pages.

An empty CSV cell means the OS cannot provide that metric. Nothing is ever
approximated from another column.

### Reading a leviath graph honestly

- `rss` far above `live`, both flat: allocator-retained lazily-freed pages.
  Not a leak. The gap disappears under system memory pressure.
- `live` climbing while runs are active, dropping when they finish: normal.
- `live` settling at a flat 20-45 MB floor after a burst, well below its
  peak: freed pages whose purge mimalloc deferred to each worker thread and
  a fully idle daemon never executes (measured: flat for 10 minutes idle,
  then partially flushed by a single follow-up run; the reachable heap at
  that moment is ~2 MB). The pages are reused by the next burst, so the
  floor does not stack across bursts. Launching the daemon with
  `MIMALLOC_PURGE_DELAY=0` purges at free time instead and roughly halves
  the floor at no measured throughput cost.
- `live` staying at its full peak after every run has finished, or a floor
  that grows burst over burst: that would be retention - file an issue with
  the CSV.

## The deterministic burst benchmark

Numbers comparing leviath builds come from a fixed workload, not from live
model traffic (model latency and token counts vary run to run; a benchmark
that includes them measures the provider, not the runtime):

1. An isolated home: `LEVIATH_HOME=/tmp/levperf`, `LEVIATH_SKIP_DOTENV=1`.
2. A Rhai mock provider (`providers/mock.rhai`) that derives its turn number
   from the conversation and returns ~25 KB `context_append` tool calls for
   12 turns, then finishes - no network, no cost, byte-identical every run.
3. A one-stage `stress` agent whose context window grows to ~77K tokens.
4. N concurrent `lev run stress --yolo` spawns, monitored with
   `leviath_monitor.py --pid <daemon pid> -i 0.5`, with a 45-second settle
   window after the last run so post-burst release is visible.

Run the same protocol on both binaries under comparison, on the same machine,
same power state. Report `live_mb` avg/peak, the settled `live_mb` after the
burst, and CPU avg/peak - never RSS alone.
